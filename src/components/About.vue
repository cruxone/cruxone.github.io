    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I love systems and programming.
    <br>It is amazing and thought provoking.
    <br>
    <br>Currently I work as a DevOps Engineer, and Python is my swiss army knife.
    <br>By night / weekend, I freelance and work on side projects. 
    <br>I've been very impressed with Angular and RxJs, as well as Vue.
    <br>Rust has been extremely fun.
